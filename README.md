# Z4
Z4 is under active development as a tool for measuring and counting zooplankton and phytoplankton taxa. Data are stored in an SQL database that can be queried to extract records. Z4 is intended to be used with a microscope and camera, but ultimately any image displayed on a computer monitor can be processed with the software.
Z4 builds on the functionality (and code) developed in Z3, a project originally funded and implemented at the Center for Limnology, University of Wisconsin - Madison.
